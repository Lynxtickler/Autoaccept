# Autoaccept
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive automatic accept button presser

## Usage
Download the file(s) anywhere and run the program.

Can be ran as an AutoHotkey script. This allows the user to modify the program however they want and change the tray icon etc.
The exe can be used as-is, no other downloaded files needed.

Pressing the activation hotkey starts a loop that clicks the Accept-button as soon as it notices one. Deactivation stops the loop and exit hotkey closes the program completely. You can make a cup of coffee and take a pee without worrying about your computer. Convenient.

## Settings
The script can launch CS:GO upon opening it and close itself after CS:GO is closed if configured to do so. To achieve this, right-click the tray icon and tick the items you want. You can also change the hotkeys used in the program. For more help with AutoHotkey hotkeys syntax visit https://autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm
